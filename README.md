# Deep-Learning-for-Cancer-Image-Segmentation


## 📌 Problem Definition
A lot of people lost their live to cancer annually.Majority of deaths due to cancer could be prevented if it is detected in its early phases.

In cancer diagnosis, radiologists must decide as to whether a possible abnormality in a given MRI/X-Ray image(s) is cancer and dismiss anything that may be mistaken for cancer cells. Moreover, there is always a chance of cancer passing unnoticed even through experienced eyes.


The primary objective of this project is to prepare a Deep Learning model that analyses the small patches of pathology scans of metastatic cancer in early phases using Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN).
